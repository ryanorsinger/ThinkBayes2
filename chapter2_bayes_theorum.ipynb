    "As an example, we used data from the General Social Survey and Bayes’s Theorem to compute conditional probabilities. But since we had the complete dataset, we didn’t really need Bayes’s Theorem. It was easy enough to compute the left side of the equation directly, and no easier to compute the right side.\n",
